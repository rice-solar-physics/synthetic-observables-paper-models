  abstract = {The recent analysis of observations taken with the EUV Imaging Spectrometer and X-Ray Telescope instruments on Hinode suggests that well-constrained measurements of the temperature distribution in solar active regions can finally be made. Such measurements are critical for constraining theories of coronal heating. Past analysis, however, has suffered from limited sample sizes and large uncertainties at temperatures between 5 and 10~MK. Here we present a systematic study of the differential emission measure distribution in 15 active region cores. We focus on measurements in the inter-moss region, that is, the region between the loop footpoints, where the observations are easier to interpret. To reduce the uncertainties at the highest temperatures we present a new method for isolating the Fe XVIII emission in the AIA/SDO 94 \AA{} channel. The resulting differential emission measure distributions confirm our previous analysis showing that the temperature distribution in an active region core is often strongly peaked near 4~MK. We characterize the properties of the emission distribution as a function of the total unsigned magnetic flux. We find that the amount of high-temperature emission in the active region core is correlated with the total unsigned magnetic flux, while the emission at lower temperatures, in contrast, is inversely related. These results provide compelling evidence that high-temperature active region emission is often close to equilibrium, although weaker active regions may be dominated by evolving million degree loops in the core.},

  doi = {10.1051/0004-6361/200810735},
  abstract = {Context: The effects of non-equilibrium processes on the ionisation 
state of strongly emitting elements in the solar corona can be extremely
difficult to assess and yet they are critically important. For example,
there is much interest in dynamic heating events localised in the solar
corona because they are believed to be responsible for its high
temperature and yet recent work has shown that the hottest
($\geq$107 K) emission predicted to be associated with these
events can be observationally elusive due to the difficulty of creating
the highly ionised states from which the expected emission arises. This
leads to the possibility of observing instruments missing such heating
events entirely. Aims: The equations describing the evolution of
the ionisaton state are a very stiff system of coupled, partial
differential equations whose solution can be numerically challenging and
time-consuming. Without access to specialised codes and significant
computational resources it is extremely difficult to avoid the
assumption of an equilibrium ionisation state even when it clearly
cannot be justified. The aim of the current work is to develop a
computational tool to allow straightforward calculation of the
time-dependent ionisation state for a wide variety of physical
circumstances. Methods: A numerical model comprising the system
of time-dependent ionisation equations for a particular element and
tabulated values of plasma temperature as a function of time is
developed. The tabulated values can be the solutions of an analytical
model, the output from a numerical code or a set of observational
measurements. An efficient numerical method to solve the ionisation
equations is implemented. Results: A suite of tests is designed
and run to demonstrate that the code provides reliable and accurate
solutions for a number of scenarios including equilibration of the ion
population and rapid heating followed by thermal conductive cooling. It
is found that the solver can evolve the ionisation state to recover
exactly the equilibrium state found by an independent, steady-state
solver for all temperatures, resolve the extremely small
ionisation/recombination timescales associated with rapid temperature
changes at high densities, and provide stable and accurate solutions for
both dominant and minor ion population fractions. Rapid heating and
cooling of low to moderate density plasma is characterised by
significant non-equilibrium ionisation conditions. The effective
ionisation temperatures are significantly lower than the electron
temperature and the values found are in close agreement with the
previous work of others. At the very highest densities included in the
present study an assumption of equilibrium ionisation is found to be
robust. Conclusions: The computational tool presented here
provides a straightforward and reliable way to calculate ionisation
states for a wide variety of physical circumstances. The numerical code
gives results that are accurate and consistent with previous studies,
has relatively undemanding computational requirements and is freely

done by solving the equations of conservation of mass, momentum, and
energy. The results reveal how the loop is filled at supersonic speed

it is predicted that a compression wave will propagate down toward the
photosphere. Once the heating pulse stops, the plasma that has risen
into the loop starts to decay and return to the condition it was in
before the pulse started. Calcium is chosen for illustration in
predicting the spectrum that would be emitted by such a plasma. The
first and main part of this calculation involves setting up and solving
the time-dependent equations of ionization/recombination. To provide a
standard for comparison, the same ionization and recombination rate
coefficients are used to predict the steady-state distribution of

The basis of EBTEL is the modeling of mass exchange between the corona and transition region (TR) and chromosphere in response to heating variations, with the key parameter being the ratio of the TR to coronal radiation. We develop new models for this parameter that now include gravitational stratification and a physically motivated approach to radiative cooling. A number of examples are presented, including nanoflares in short and long loops, and a small flare. The new features in EBTEL are important for accurate tracking of, in particular, the density. The 0D results are compared to a 1D hydro code (Hydrad) with generally good agreement. EBTEL is suitable for general use as a tool for (1) quick-look results of loop evolution in response to a given heating function, (2) extensive parameter surveys, and (3) situations where the modeling of hundreds or thousands of elemental loops is needed. A single run takes a few seconds on a contemporary laptop.},

non-equilibrium, and for short nanoflares, the time taken for the

solar active region using instruments on Hinode and the Solar Dynamics
Observatory (SDO). These multi-instrument observations allow us to
determine the distribution of plasma temperatures and follow the
evolution of emission at different temperatures. We find that at the
apex of the high-temperature loops the emission measure distribution is
strongly peaked near 4 MK and falls off sharply at both higher and lower
temperatures. Perhaps most significantly, the emission measure at 0.5 MK
is reduced by more than two orders of magnitude from the peak at 4 MK.
We also find that the temporal evolution in broadband soft X-ray images
is relatively constant over about 6 hr of observing. Observations in the
cooler SDO/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) bandpasses generally do
not show cooling loops in the core of the active region, consistent with
the steady emission observed at high temperatures. These observations
suggest that the high-temperature loops observed in the core of an
active region are close to equilibrium. We find that it is possible to
reproduce the relative intensities of high-temperature emission lines
with a simple, high-frequency heating scenario where heating events
occur on timescales much less than a characteristic cooling time. In
contrast, low-frequency heating scenarios, which are commonly invoked to
describe nanoflare models of coronal heating, do not reproduce the
relative intensities of high-temperature emission lines and predict
low-temperature emission that is approximately an order of magnitude too
large. We also present an initial look at images from the SDO/AIA 94

  abstract = {Observational and theoretical evidence suggests that coronal heating is impulsive and occurs on very small cross-field spatial scales. A single coronal loop could contain a hundred or more individual strands that are heated quasi-independently by nanoflares. It is therefore an enormous undertaking to model an entire active region or the global corona. Three-dimensional MHD codes have inadequate spatial resolution, and one-dimensional (1D) hydrodynamic codes are too slow to simulate the many thousands of elemental strands that must be treated in a reasonable representation. Fortunately, thermal conduction and flows tend to smooth out plasma gradients along the magnetic field, so zero-dimensional (0D) models are an acceptable alternative. We have developed a highly efficient model called ‘‘enthalpy-based thermal evolution of loops'' (EBTEL), which accurately describes the evolution of the average temperature, pressure, and density along a coronal strand. It improves significantly on earlier models of this type-in accuracy, flexibility, and capability. It treats both slowly varying and highly impulsive coronal heating; it provides the time-dependent differential emission measure distribution, DEM(T), at the transition region footpoints; and there are options for heat flux saturation and nonthermal electron beam heating. EBTEL gives excellent agreement with far more sophisticated 1D hydrodynamic simulations despite using 4 orders of magnitude less computing time. It promises to be a powerful new tool for solar and stellar studies.},

Aims: .We study the physics associated with nanoflare heating in this scenario and aim to determine whether there exist any observable signatures. Methods: .We derive an analytical model in order to gain some simple physical insights into the system and use a one dimensional hydrodynamic model that treats the electrons and ions as a coupled fluid to simulate nanoflare heating with time-scales of 30 s. Our analytical model also provide a means of verifying our numerical results. Results: .We find that diffuse loops containing plasma at T$>$ 20 MK can be rapidly created and subsequently filled by the violent evaporation of chromospheric plasma driven by near-saturated thermal conduction. Most importantly, we find order-of-magnitude departures from equilibrium of the ionisation balance for iron and use this result to identify a potential signature of this heating
mechanism. Conclusions: .We conclude that nanoflare heating can account for the presence of extremely high temperature plasma in a corona with low filling factor. We find that near-saturated thermal conduction may play a key role at the onset of chromospheric evaporation and a non-equilibrium ionisation balance is absolutely inevitable. The high temperatures could never be directly measured in the corona due to the small emission measure and the most promising signature of such heating is blue-shifted plasma from the loop footpoints. We find reason for cautious optimism that this signature can be detected by future space-based spectroscopic instrumentation (e.g. SolarB-EIS).},

  abstract = {A well-known behavior of EUV light curves of discrete coronal loops is 
that the peak intensities of cooler channels or spectral lines are
reached at progressively later times than hotter channels. This time lag
is understood to be the result of hot coronal loop plasma cooling
through these lower respective temperatures. However, loops typically
comprise only a minority of the total emission in active regions (ARs).
Is this cooling pattern a common property of AR coronal plasma, or does
it only occur in unique circumstances, locations, and times? The new
Solar Dynamics Observatory/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (SDO/AIA) data
provide a wonderful opportunity to answer this question systematically
for an entire AR. We measure the time lag between pairs of SDO/AIA EUV
channels using 24 hr of images of AR 11082 observed on 2010 June 19. We
find that there is a time-lag signal consistent with cooling plasma,
just as is usually found for loops, throughout the AR including the
diffuse emission between loops for the entire 24 hr duration. The
pattern persists consistently for all channel pairs and choice of window
length within the 24 hr time period, giving us confidence that the
plasma is cooling from temperatures of greater than 3 MK, and sometimes
exceeding 7 MK, down to temperatures lower than \textasciitilde{}0.8 MK. This suggests
that the bulk of the emitting coronal plasma in this AR is not steady;
rather, it is dynamic and constantly evolving. These measurements
provide crucial constraints on any model which seeks to describe coronal
heating.},

TN must then be of the order of hundreds to no more than a
few thousand seconds. If a nanoflare leads to the relaxation of a
stressed coronal field to a near-potential state, the time taken to
build up the required magnetic energy is thus too long to account for
the EM measurements. Instead, it is suggested that a nanoflare involves
the relaxation from one stressed coronal state to another, dissipating
only a small fraction of the available magnetic energy. A consequence is
that nanoflare energies may be smaller than previously envisioned.},

0D models that have been published in the past and is intended to
provide a guide for those interested in either using the old models or
developing new ones. The principal difference between the models is the
way the exchange of mass and energy between corona, transition region,
and chromosphere is treated, as plasma cycles into and out of a loop
during a heating-cooling cycle. It is shown that models based on the
principles of mass and energy conservation can give satisfactory results
at some or, in the case of the Enthalpy-based Thermal Evolution of Loops
model, all stages of the loop evolution. Empirical models can have
significant difficulties in obtaining accurate behavior due to
invocation of assumptions incompatible with the correct exchange of mass
and energy between corona, transition region, and chromosphere.},

confined in coronal loops to temperatures of the order of 10 MK. Such
hot plasma is hardly detected in quiet and active regions, outside

can be highly out of equilibrium in ionization. Here we investigate the
effects of the nonequilibrium of ionization (NEI) on the detection of
hot plasma in coronal loops. Time-dependent loop hydrodynamic
simulations are specifically devoted to this task, including saturated
thermal conduction, and coupled to the detailed solution of the
equations of the ionization rate for several abundant elements. In our
simulations, initially cool and rarefied magnetic flux tubes are heated
to 10 MK by nanoflares deposited either at the footpoints or at the loop
apex. We test for different pulse durations and find that, due to NEI
effects, the loop plasma may never be detected at temperatures above \textasciitilde{}5
MK for heat pulses shorter than about 1 minute. We discuss some
implications in the framework of multistranded nanoflare-heated coronal
loops.},

general-purpose, high-level programming language, has seen widespread adoption among the scientific community, resulting in the availability of a large number of software packages, from numerical computation (NumPy, SciPy) and machine learning (scikit-learn) to visualization and plotting (matplotlib). SunPy is a data-analysis environment specializing in providing the software necessary to analyse solar and heliospheric data in Python. SunPy is open-source software (BSD licence) and has an open and transparent development workflow that anyone can contribute to. SunPy provides access to solar data through integration with the Virtual Solar Observatory (VSO), the Heliophysics Event Knowledgebase (HEK), and the HELiophysics Integrated Observatory (HELIO) webservices. It
currently supports image data from major solar missions (e.g., SDO, SOHO, STEREO, and IRIS), time-series data from missions such as GOES, SDO/EVE, and PROBA2/LYRA, and radio spectra from e-Callisto and
STEREO/SWAVES. We describe SunPy's functionality, provide examples of solar data analysis in SunPy, and show how Python-based solar data-analysis can leverage the many existing tools already available in Python. We discuss the future goals of the project and encourage interested users to become involved in the planning and development of SunPy.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we examine 15 different active regions (ARs) observed with the Solar Dynamics Observatory and analyze their nanoflare properties. We have recently developed a technique that systematically identifies and measures plasma temperature dynamics by computing time lags between light curves. The time lag method tests whether the plasma is maintained at a steady temperature, or if it is dynamic, undergoing heating and cooling cycles. An important aspect of our technique is that it analyzes both observationally distinct coronal loops as well as the much more prevalent diffuse emission between them. We find that the widespread cooling reported previously for NOAA AR 11082 is a generic property of all ARs. The results are consistent with impulsive nanoflare heating followed by slower cooling. Only occasionally, however, is there full cooling from above 7 MK to well below 1 MK. More often, the plasma cools to approximately 1\textendash{}2 MK before being reheated by another nanoflare. These same 15 ARs were first studied by Warren et al. We find that the degree of cooling is not well correlated with the reported slopes of the emission measure distribution. We also conclude that the Fe xviii emitting plasma that they measured is mostly in a state of cooling. These results support the idea that nanoflares have a distribution of energies and frequencies, with the average delay between successive events on an individual flux tube being comparable to the plasma cooling timescale.},

  abstract = {The Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) began near-continuous full-disk solar measurements on 1 May 2010 from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). An automated processing pipeline keeps pace with observations to produce observable quantities, including the photospheric vector magnetic field, from sequences of filtergrams. The basic vector-field frame list cadence is 135 seconds, but to reduce noise the filtergrams are combined to derive data products every 720 seconds. The primary 720 s observables were released in mid-2010, including Stokes polarization parameters measured at six wavelengths, as well as intensity, Doppler velocity, and the line-of-sight magnetic field. More advanced products, including the full vector magnetic field, are now available. Automatically identified HMI Active Region Patches (HARPs) track the location and shape of magnetic regions throughout their lifetime.The vector field is computed using the Very Fast Inversion of the Stokes Vector (VFISV) code optimized for the HMI pipeline; the remaining 180$\circ$ azimuth ambiguity is resolved with the Minimum Energy (ME0) code. The Milne\textendash{}Eddington inversion is performed on all full-disk HMI observations. The disambiguation, until recently run only on HARP regions, is now implemented for the full disk. Vector and scalar quantities in the patches are used to derive active region indices potentially useful for forecasting; the data maps and indices are collected in the SHARP data series, hmi.sharp\_720s. Definitive SHARP processing is completed only after the region rotates off the visible disk; quick-look products are produced in near real time. Patches are provided in both CCD and heliographic coordinates.HMI provides continuous coverage of the vector field, but has modest spatial, spectral, and temporal resolution. Coupled with limitations of the analysis and interpretation techniques, effects of the orbital velocity, and instrument performance, the resulting measurements have a certain dynamic range and sensitivity and are subject to systematic errors and uncertainties that are characterized in this report.},
