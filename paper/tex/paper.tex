%% Use AASTeX class, version 6.1
%% Allow for additional class options such as,
%%  twocolumn   : two text columns, 10 point font, single spaced article.
%%                This is the most compact and represent the final published
%%                derived PDF copy of the accepted manuscript from the publisher
%%  manuscript  : one text column, 12 point font, double spaced article.
%%  preprint    : one text column, 12 point font, single spaced article.  
%%  preprint2   : two text columns, 12 point font, single spaced article.
%%  modern      : a stylish, single text column, 12 point font, article with
%% 		            wider left and right margins. This uses the Daniel
%% 		            Foreman-Mackey and David Hogg design.
%%  astrosymb    : Loads Astrosymb font and define \astrocommands. 
%%  tighten      : Makes baselineskip slightly smaller, only works with 
%%                 the twocolumn substyle.
%%  times        : uses times font instead of the default
%%  linenumbers  : turn on lineno package.
%%  trackchanges : required to see the revision mark up and print its output
%%  longauthor   : Do not use the more compressed footnote style (default) for 
%%                 the author/collaboration/affiliations. Instead print all
%%                 affiliation information after each name. Creates a much
%%                 long author list but may be desirable for short author papers
