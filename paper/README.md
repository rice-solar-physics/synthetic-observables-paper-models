Brainstorming and notes around paper

## Title: Synthetic Observables I. Models

* Use EBTEL to simulate many loops in AR NOAA 1158
* Survey several different heating models
  * Low frequency
  * Intermediate frequency
  * High frequency
  * Randomly occurring nanoflares (maximally decoherent)
  * Single pulse, cooling only (maximally coherent)
* Compute AIA intensities in all 6 channels
* Compute timelags for all 15 channel pairs
* Compute emission measure slopes
* Primary Question: What are the observable signatures of these different heating frequencies?

### Color Palette

* For our three different heating functions, use the first three colors in the `colorblind` palette in Seaborn
* For different elements in the response function plot, use colorbrewer `Set1`
