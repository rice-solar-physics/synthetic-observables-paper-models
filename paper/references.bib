  abstract = {The recent analysis of observations taken with the EUV Imaging Spectrometer and X-Ray Telescope instruments on Hinode suggests that well-constrained measurements of the temperature distribution in solar active regions can finally be made. Such measurements are critical for constraining theories of coronal heating. Past analysis, however, has suffered from limited sample sizes and large uncertainties at temperatures between 5 and 10~MK. Here we present a systematic study of the differential emission measure distribution in 15 active region cores. We focus on measurements in the inter-moss region, that is, the region between the loop footpoints, where the observations are easier to interpret. To reduce the uncertainties at the highest temperatures we present a new method for isolating the Fe XVIII emission in the AIA/SDO 94 \AA{} channel. The resulting differential emission measure distributions confirm our previous analysis showing that the temperature distribution in an active region core is often strongly peaked near 4~MK. We characterize the properties of the emission distribution as a function of the total unsigned magnetic flux. We find that the amount of high-temperature emission in the active region core is correlated with the total unsigned magnetic flux, while the emission at lower temperatures, in contrast, is inversely related. These results provide compelling evidence that high-temperature active region emission is often close to equilibrium, although weaker active regions may be dominated by evolving million degree loops in the core.},

  abstract = {The coronal heating mechanism for active region core loops is difficult to determine because these loops are often not resolved and cannot be studied individually. Rather, we concentrate on the "inter-moss" areas between loop footpoints. We use observations from the Hinode EUV Imaging Spectrometer and the X-Ray Telescope to calculate the emission measure distributions of eight inter-moss areas in five different active regions. The combined data sets provide both high- and low-temperature constraints and ensure complete coverage in the temperature range appropriate for active regions. For AR 11113, the emission can be modeled with heating events that occur on timescales less than the cooling time. The loops in the core regions appear to be close to equilibrium and are consistent with steady heating. The other regions studied, however, appear to be dominated by nanoflare heating. Our results are consistent with the idea that active region age is an important parameter in determining whether steady or nanoflare heating is primarily responsible for the core emission, that is, older regions are more likely to be dominated by steady heating, while younger regions show more evidence of nanoflares.},

  issn = {0004-6361},
  doi = {10.1051/0004-6361/200810735},
  abstract = {Context: The effects of non-equilibrium processes on the ionisation 
state of strongly emitting elements in the solar corona can be extremely
difficult to assess and yet they are critically important. For example,
there is much interest in dynamic heating events localised in the solar
corona because they are believed to be responsible for its high
temperature and yet recent work has shown that the hottest
($\geq$107 K) emission predicted to be associated with these
events can be observationally elusive due to the difficulty of creating
the highly ionised states from which the expected emission arises. This
leads to the possibility of observing instruments missing such heating
events entirely. Aims: The equations describing the evolution of
the ionisaton state are a very stiff system of coupled, partial
differential equations whose solution can be numerically challenging and
time-consuming. Without access to specialised codes and significant
computational resources it is extremely difficult to avoid the
assumption of an equilibrium ionisation state even when it clearly
cannot be justified. The aim of the current work is to develop a
computational tool to allow straightforward calculation of the
time-dependent ionisation state for a wide variety of physical
circumstances. Methods: A numerical model comprising the system
of time-dependent ionisation equations for a particular element and
tabulated values of plasma temperature as a function of time is
developed. The tabulated values can be the solutions of an analytical
model, the output from a numerical code or a set of observational
measurements. An efficient numerical method to solve the ionisation
equations is implemented. Results: A suite of tests is designed
and run to demonstrate that the code provides reliable and accurate
solutions for a number of scenarios including equilibration of the ion
population and rapid heating followed by thermal conductive cooling. It
is found that the solver can evolve the ionisation state to recover
exactly the equilibrium state found by an independent, steady-state
solver for all temperatures, resolve the extremely small
ionisation/recombination timescales associated with rapid temperature
changes at high densities, and provide stable and accurate solutions for
both dominant and minor ion population fractions. Rapid heating and
cooling of low to moderate density plasma is characterised by
significant non-equilibrium ionisation conditions. The effective
ionisation temperatures are significantly lower than the electron
temperature and the values found are in close agreement with the
previous work of others. At the very highest densities included in the
present study an assumption of equilibrium ionisation is found to be
robust. Conclusions: The computational tool presented here
provides a straightforward and reliable way to calculate ionisation
states for a wide variety of physical circumstances. The numerical code
gives results that are accurate and consistent with previous studies,
has relatively undemanding computational requirements and is freely
available from the author.},

done by solving the equations of conservation of mass, momentum, and
energy. The results reveal how the loop is filled at supersonic speed
with plasma at temperatures characteristic of flares. At the same time
it is predicted that a compression wave will propagate down toward the
photosphere. Once the heating pulse stops, the plasma that has risen
into the loop starts to decay and return to the condition it was in
before the pulse started. Calcium is chosen for illustration in
predicting the spectrum that would be emitted by such a plasma. The
first and main part of this calculation involves setting up and solving
the time-dependent equations of ionization/recombination. To provide a
standard for comparison, the same ionization and recombination rate
coefficients are used to predict the steady-state distribution of

The basis of EBTEL is the modeling of mass exchange between the corona and transition region (TR) and chromosphere in response to heating variations, with the key parameter being the ratio of the TR to coronal radiation. We develop new models for this parameter that now include gravitational stratification and a physically motivated approach to radiative cooling. A number of examples are presented, including nanoflares in short and long loops, and a small flare. The new features in EBTEL are important for accurate tracking of, in particular, the density. The 0D results are compared to a 1D hydro code (Hydrad) with generally good agreement. EBTEL is suitable for general use as a tool for (1) quick-look results of loop evolution in response to a given heating function, (2) extensive parameter surveys, and (3) situations where the modeling of hundreds or thousands of elemental loops is needed. A single run takes a few seconds on a contemporary laptop.},

Observatory (SDO). These multi-instrument observations allow us to
determine the distribution of plasma temperatures and follow the

apex of the high-temperature loops the emission measure distribution is
strongly peaked near 4 MK and falls off sharply at both higher and lower
temperatures. Perhaps most significantly, the emission measure at 0.5 MK
is reduced by more than two orders of magnitude from the peak at 4 MK.
We also find that the temporal evolution in broadband soft X-ray images
is relatively constant over about 6 hr of observing. Observations in the
cooler SDO/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) bandpasses generally do
not show cooling loops in the core of the active region, consistent with
the steady emission observed at high temperatures. These observations
suggest that the high-temperature loops observed in the core of an
active region are close to equilibrium. We find that it is possible to
reproduce the relative intensities of high-temperature emission lines
with a simple, high-frequency heating scenario where heating events
occur on timescales much less than a characteristic cooling time. In
contrast, low-frequency heating scenarios, which are commonly invoked to
describe nanoflare models of coronal heating, do not reproduce the
relative intensities of high-temperature emission lines and predict
low-temperature emission that is approximately an order of magnitude too
large. We also present an initial look at images from the SDO/AIA 94

  abstract = {All theories that attempt to explain the heating of the high-temperature 
plasma observed in the solar corona are based on short bursts of energy.
The intensities and velocities measured in the cores of quiescent active
regions, however, can be steady over many hours of observation. One
heating scenario that has been proposed to reconcile such observations
with impulsive heating models is the "long nanoflare storm," where
short-duration heating events occur infrequently on many sub-resolution
strands; the emission of the strands is then averaged together to
explain the observed steady structures. In this Letter, we examine the
emission measure distribution predicted for such a long nanoflare storm
by modeling an arcade of strands in an active region core. Comparisons
of the computed emission measure distributions with recent observations
indicate that the long nanoflare storm scenario implies greater than
five times more 1 MK emission than is actually observed for all
plausible combinations of loop lengths, heating rates, and abundances.
We conjecture that if the plasma had "super coronal" abundances, the
model may be able to match the observations at low temperatures.},

With cooled detectors, high sensitivity, and high spectral resolution, EUNIS-13 resolves the lines of Fe XIX at 592.2 \AA{} (formed at temperature T 8.9 MK) and Fe XII at 592.6 \AA{} (T 1.6 MK). The Fe XIX line emission, observed over an area in excess of 4920 arcsec2 (2.58 \texttimes{} 109 km2, more than 60\% of the active region), provides strong evidence for the nanoflare heating model of the solar corona. No GOES events occurred in the region less than 2 hr before the rocket flight, but a microflare was observed north and east of the region with RHESSI and EUNIS during the flight. The absence of significant upward velocities anywhere in the region, particularly the microflare, indicates that the pervasive Fe XIX emission is not propelled outward from the microflare site, but is most likely attributed to localized heating (not necessarily due to reconnection) consistent with the nanoflare heating model of the solar corona. Assuming ionization equilibrium we estimate Fe XIX/Fe XII emission measure ratios of \textasciitilde{}0.076 just outside the AR core and \textasciitilde{}0.59 in the core.},

are heated by storms of impulsive nanoflares. The nature of coronal
heating in hotter loops and in the very important but largely ignored
diffuse component of active regions is much less clear. Are these

spectacular new data from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA)
telescopes on the Solar Dynamics Observatory offer an excellent
opportunity to address this question. We analyze the light curves of
coronal loops and the diffuse corona in six different AIA channels and
compare them with the predicted light curves from theoretical models.
Light curves in the different AIA channels reach their peak intensities
with predictable orderings as a function the nanoflare storm properties.
We show that while some sets of light curves exhibit clear evidence of
cooling after nanoflare storms, other cases are less straightforward to
interpret. Complications arise because of line-of-sight integration
through many different structures, the broadband nature of the AIA
channels, and because physical properties can change substantially
depending on the magnitude of the energy release. Nevertheless, the
light curves exhibit predictable and understandable patterns consistent
with impulsive nanoflare heating.},

  abstract = {The light curves of solar coronal loops often peak first in channels associated with higher temperatures and then in those associated with lower temperatures. The delay times between the different narrowband EUV channels have been measured for many individual loops and recently for every pixel of an active region observation. The time delays between channels for an active region exhibit a wide range of values. The maximum time delay in each channel pair can be quite large, i.e., $>$5000 s. These large time delays make-up 3\%\textendash{}26\% (depending on the channel pair) of the pixels where a trustworthy, positive time delay is measured. It has been suggested that these time delays can be explained by simple impulsive heating, i.e., a short burst of energy that heats the plasma to a high temperature, after which the plasma is allowed to cool through radiation and conduction back to its original state. In this paper, we investigate whether the largest observed time delays can be explained by this hypothesis by simulating a series of coronal loops with different heating rates, loop lengths, abundances, and geometries to determine the range of expected time delays between a set of four EUV channels. We find that impulsive heating cannot address the largest time delays observed in two of the channel pairs and that the majority of the large time delays can only be explained by long, expanding loops with photospheric abundances. Additional observations may rule out these simulations as an explanation for the long time delays. We suggest that either the time delays found in this manner may not be representative of real loop evolution, or that the impulsive heating and cooling scenario may be too simple to explain the observations, and other potential heating scenarios must be explored.},

By assuming that quiescent loop structures observed in X-rays are in hydrostatic equilibrium, it is demonstrated that such loops must have their temperature maximum located near their apex and that substantial nonradiative energy deposition must occur along most of their length. The calculations yield a unique relation among loop temperature, pressure, and size, which fits the X-ray observations of quiescent structures well and is consistent with the initial assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium. The results suggest that the coronal loops visible in X-rays represent a relatively
steady-state equilibrium of the confined plasmas and that fluctuations in such quantities as the local heating rate can lead to dynamically unstable states in which the loop plasma does not attain a temperature sufficient for X-ray emission.

If an observed coronal loop is assumed to consist of many small strands that cannot be distinguished spatially by EUV or X-ray observations, we are able to calculate differential emission-measure profiles and filling factors for a range of heating models. In this picture the strands undergo continual heating and cooling, leading to a corona comprising strands with a broad range of temperatures and densities. Thus, observations over a range of temperatures will show a multithermal coronal structure. The cyclical heating-cooling leads inevitably to loops that are underdense and overdense at high and low temperatures, respectively, compared to what would be expected from static equilibrium models, and in addition, we show that differential emission-measure profiles with shallow slopes can be obtained, as reported in recent observations. The differences between filling factors that can be seen by broadband and narrowband instruments are explored. Loops with broadband filling factors near unity can still have small narrowband factors, and the narrowband factor is shown to be a strong function of the local temperature. Nanoflare energy distributions that are constant, flat, or power laws are considered. Power laws lead to wide distributions of temperatures and densities in the corona, and steep power laws lead to larger filling factors.},

  abstract = {The location and frequency of coronal energy release provide a significant constraint on the coronal heating mechanism. The evolution of the intensity observed in coronal structures found from time lag analysis of Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) data has been used to argue that heating must occur sporadically. Recently, we have demonstrated that quasi-steady, highly stratified (footpoint) heating can produce results qualitatively consistent with the evolution of observed coronal structures. The goals of this paper are to demonstrate that time lag analysis of 3D simulations of footpoint heating are qualitatively consistent with time lag analysis of observations and to use the 3D simulations to further understand whether time lag analysis is a useful tool in defining the evolution of coronal structures. We find the time lag maps generated from simulated data are consistent with the observed time lag maps. We next investigate several example points. In some cases, the calculated time lag reflects the evolution of a unique loop along the line of sight, though there may be additional evolving structures along the line of sight. We confirm that using the multi-peak AIA channels can produce time lags that are difficult to interpret. We suggest using a different high temperature channel, such as an X-ray channel. Finally, we find that multiple evolving structures along the line of sight can produce time lags that do not represent the physical properties of any structure along the line of sight, although the cross-correlation coefficient of the lightcurves is high. Considering the projected geometry of the loops may reduce some of the line-of-sight confusion.},

that can occur when the heating is both highly stratified and
quasi-constant. Unambiguous observational identification of TNE would
thus permit us to strongly constrain heating scenarios. While TNE is
currently the standard interpretation of coronal rain, the long-term
periodic evolution predicted by simulations has never been observed.
However, the detection of long-period intensity pulsations (periods of
several hours) has been recently reported with the Solar and
Heliospheric Observatory/EIT, and this phenomenon appears to be very
common in loops. Moreover, the three intensity-pulsation events that we
recently studied with the Solar Dynamics Observatory/Atmospheric Imaging
Assembly (AIA) show strong evidence for TNE in warm loops. In this
paper, a realistic loop geometry from linear force-free field (LFFF)
extrapolations is used as input to 1D hydrodynamic simulations. Our
simulations show that, for the present loop geometry, the heating has to
be asymmetrical to produce TNE. We analyze in detail one particular
simulation that reproduces the average thermal behavior of one of the
pulsating loop bundle observed with AIA. We compare the properties of
this simulation with those deduced from the observations. The magnetic
topology of the LFFF extrapolations points to the presence of sites of
preferred reconnection at one footpoint, supporting the presence of
asymmetric heating. In addition, we can reproduce the temporal
large-scale intensity properties of the pulsating loops. This simulation
further strengthens the interpretation of the observed pulsations as
signatures of TNE. This consequently provides important information on
the heating localization and timescale for these loops.},

coronal heating problem. However, the frequent occurrence of nanoflares
requires that flare-hot plasma be present in the corona at all times.
Its detection has proved elusive until now, in part because the
intensities are predicted to be very faint. Here, we report on the
analysis of an active region observed with five filters by Hinode/X-Ray
Telescope (XRT) in 2006 November. We have used the filter ratio method
to derive maps of temperature and emission measure (EM) both in soft and
hard ratios. These maps are approximate in that the plasma is assumed to
be isothermal along each line of sight. Nonetheless, the hardest
available ratio reveals the clear presence of plasma around 10 MK. To
obtain more detailed information about the plasma properties, we have
performed Monte Carlo simulations assuming a variety of nonisothermal EM
distributions along the lines of sight. We find that the observed filter
ratios imply bi-modal distributions consisting of a strong cool (log T \textasciitilde{}
6.3 - 6.5) component and a weaker (few percent) and hotter (6.6 $<$ log
T $<$ 7.2) component. The data are consistent with bi-modal
distributions along all lines of sight, i.e., throughout the active
region. We also find that the isothermal temperature inferred from a
filter ratio depends sensitively on the precise temperature of the cool
component. A slight shift of this component can cause the hot component
to be obscured in a hard ratio measurement. Consequently, temperature
maps made in hard and soft ratios tend to be anti-correlated. We
conclude that this observation supports the presence of widespread
nanoflaring activity in the active region.},

  abstract = {Observing high-temperature, low emission measure plasma is key to unlocking the coronal heating problem. With current instrumentation, a combination of EUV spectral data from Hinode Extreme-ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer (EIS; sensitive to temperatures up to 4 MK) and broadband filter data from Hinode X-ray Telescope (XRT; sensitive to higher temperatures) is typically used to diagnose the temperature structure of the observed plasma. In this Letter, we demonstrate that a "blind spot" exists in temperature-emission measure space for combined Hinode EIS and XRT observations. For a typical active region core with significant emission at 3-4 MK, Hinode EIS and XRT are insensitive to plasma with temperatures greater than \textasciitilde{}6 MK and emission measures less than
\textasciitilde{}1027 cm-5. We then demonstrate that the
temperature and emission measure limits of this blind spot depend upon the temperature distribution of the plasma along the line of sight by considering a hypothetical emission measure distribution sharply peaked at 1 MK. For this emission measure distribution, we find that EIS and XRT are insensitive to plasma with emission measures less than
\textasciitilde{}1026 cm-5. We suggest that a spatially and spectrally resolved 6-24 \AA{} spectrum would improve the sensitivity to these high-temperature, low emission measure plasma.},

  abstract = {The solar corona is orders of magnitude hotter than the underlying photosphere, but how the corona attains such high temperatures is still not understood. Soft X-ray (SXR) emission provides important diagnostics for thermal processes in the high-temperature corona, and is also an important driver of ionospheric dynamics at Earth. There is a crucial observational gap between \texttildelow{}0.2 and \texttildelow{}4 keV, outside the ranges of existing spectrometers. We present observations from a new SXR
spectrometer, the Amptek X123-SDD, which measured the spatially
integrated solar spectral irradiance from \texttildelow{}0.5 to \texttildelow{}5 keV, with
\texttildelow{}0.15 keV FWHM resolution, during sounding rocket flights on 2012 June 23 and 2013 October 21. These measurements show that the highly variable SXR emission is orders of magnitude greater than that during the deep minimum of 2009, even with only weak activity. The observed spectra show significant high-temperature (5-10 MK) emission and are well fit by simple power-law temperature distributions with indices of \texttildelow{}6, close to the predictions of nanoflare models of coronal
heating. Observations during the more active 2013 flight indicate an enrichment of low first-ionization potential elements of only \texttildelow{}1.6, below the usually observed value of \texttildelow{}4, suggesting that abundance variations may be related to coronal heating processes. The XUV
Photometer System Level 4 data product, a spectral irradiance model derived from integrated broadband measurements, significantly
overestimates the spectra from both flights, suggesting a need for revision of its non-flare reference spectra, with important implications for studies of Earth ionospheric dynamics driven by solar SXRs.},

  abstract = {Aims: To demonstrate the capabilities of regularized inversion to 
recover differential emission measures (DEMs) from multi-wavelength
observations provided by telescopes such as Hinode and SDO. 
Methods: We develop and apply an enhanced regularization algorithm, used
in RHESSI X-ray spectral analysis, to constrain the ill-posed inverse
problem that is determining the DEM from solar observations. We
demonstrate this computationally fast technique applied to a range of
DEM models simulating broadband imaging data from SDO/AIA and high
resolution line spectra from Hinode/EIS, as well as actual active region
observations with Hinode/EIS and XRT. As this regularization method
naturally provides both vertical and horizontal (temperature resolution)
error bars we are able to test the role of uncertainties in the data and
response functions. Results: The regularization method is able to
successfully recover the DEM from simulated data of a variety of model
DEMs (single Gaussian, multiple Gaussians and CHIANTI DEM models). It is
able to do this, at best, to over four orders of magnitude in DEM space
but typically over two orders of magnitude from peak emission. The
combination of horizontal and vertical error bars and the regularized
solution matrix allows us to easily determine the accuracy and
robustness of the regularized DEM. We find that the typical range for
the horizontal errors is $\Delta$log T $\approx$ 0.1-0.5 and this is dependent
on the observed signal to noise, uncertainty in the response functions
as well as the source model and temperature. With Hinode/EIS an
uncertainty of 20\% greatly broadens the regularized DEMs for both
Gaussian and CHIANTI models although information about the underlying
DEMs is still recoverable. When applied to real active region
observations with Hinode/EIS and XRT the regularization method is able
to recover a DEM similar to that found via a MCMC method but in
considerably less computational time. Conclusions: Regularized
inversion quickly determines the DEM from solar observations and
provides reliable error estimates (both horizontal and vertical) which
allows the temperature spread of coronal plasma to be robustly
quantified.},

  abstract = {The concept that the corona is heated by small flares (named 'nanoflares' by Parker) is examined. A model in which the closed, active region corona is comprised of many hundred of small elemental flux loops randomly heated by nanoflares is presentd. The cooling of these flux loops is examined using analytic techniques. It is assumed that the heated loops cool initially by conduction and at later times by
radiation. Radiative cooling with and without downward mass flows are discussed, the experimental signature of such a coronal model are predicted. The distribution of temperatures in these loops peaks at around 2 x 106 K, while the distribution of densities peaks above 1010/cu cm. For 2 x 105 K less than T less than 106 K, radiative cooling with mass flows gives an emission measure that scales as T1.5, in agreement with existing observations. For T greater than 106 K, the emission measure increases more steeply, scaling as T4.5. These scalings are entirely due to the temperature dependence of the radiative loss function. It is shown that such a loop model has filling factors (defined as the ratio of the volume of hot plasma to the total volume) of order unity for subarcsecond energy release scales. A brief survey of the dependence of the results on the parameters of the system is presented. The temperature distribution function and emission measure are relatively insensitive to the loop length, coronal energy loss, number of elemental loops, and nanoflare energy, but the filling factor is dependent on these quantities. A simple scaling for this dependence is presented.},

  doi = {10.1086/589426},
  abstract = {Observational and theoretical evidence suggests that coronal heating is impulsive and occurs on very small cross-field spatial scales. A single coronal loop could contain a hundred or more individual strands that are heated quasi-independently by nanoflares. It is therefore an enormous undertaking to model an entire active region or the global corona. Three-dimensional MHD codes have inadequate spatial resolution, and one-dimensional (1D) hydrodynamic codes are too slow to simulate the many thousands of elemental strands that must be treated in a reasonable representation. Fortunately, thermal conduction and flows tend to smooth out plasma gradients along the magnetic field, so zero-dimensional (0D) models are an acceptable alternative. We have developed a highly efficient model called ‘‘enthalpy-based thermal evolution of loops'' (EBTEL), which accurately describes the evolution of the average temperature, pressure, and density along a coronal strand. It improves significantly on earlier models of this type-in accuracy, flexibility, and capability. It treats both slowly varying and highly impulsive coronal heating; it provides the time-dependent differential emission measure distribution, DEM(T), at the transition region footpoints; and there are options for heat flux saturation and nonthermal electron beam heating. EBTEL gives excellent agreement with far more sophisticated 1D hydrodynamic simulations despite using 4 orders of magnitude less computing time. It promises to be a powerful new tool for solar and stellar studies.},

Aims: .We study the physics associated with nanoflare heating in this scenario and aim to determine whether there exist any observable signatures. Methods: .We derive an analytical model in order to gain some simple physical insights into the system and use a one dimensional hydrodynamic model that treats the electrons and ions as a coupled fluid to simulate nanoflare heating with time-scales of 30 s. Our analytical model also provide a means of verifying our numerical results. Results: .We find that diffuse loops containing plasma at T$>$ 20 MK can be rapidly created and subsequently filled by the violent evaporation of chromospheric plasma driven by near-saturated thermal conduction. Most importantly, we find order-of-magnitude departures from equilibrium of the ionisation balance for iron and use this result to identify a potential signature of this heating
mechanism. Conclusions: .We conclude that nanoflare heating can account for the presence of extremely high temperature plasma in a corona with low filling factor. We find that near-saturated thermal conduction may play a key role at the onset of chromospheric evaporation and a non-equilibrium ionisation balance is absolutely inevitable. The high temperatures could never be directly measured in the corona due to the small emission measure and the most promising signature of such heating is blue-shifted plasma from the loop footpoints. We find reason for cautious optimism that this signature can be detected by future space-based spectroscopic instrumentation (e.g. SolarB-EIS).},

  abstract = {A well-known behavior of EUV light curves of discrete coronal loops is 
that the peak intensities of cooler channels or spectral lines are
reached at progressively later times than hotter channels. This time lag
is understood to be the result of hot coronal loop plasma cooling
through these lower respective temperatures. However, loops typically
comprise only a minority of the total emission in active regions (ARs).
Is this cooling pattern a common property of AR coronal plasma, or does
it only occur in unique circumstances, locations, and times? The new
Solar Dynamics Observatory/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (SDO/AIA) data
provide a wonderful opportunity to answer this question systematically
for an entire AR. We measure the time lag between pairs of SDO/AIA EUV
channels using 24 hr of images of AR 11082 observed on 2010 June 19. We
find that there is a time-lag signal consistent with cooling plasma,
just as is usually found for loops, throughout the AR including the
diffuse emission between loops for the entire 24 hr duration. The
pattern persists consistently for all channel pairs and choice of window
length within the 24 hr time period, giving us confidence that the
plasma is cooling from temperatures of greater than 3 MK, and sometimes
exceeding 7 MK, down to temperatures lower than \textasciitilde{}0.8 MK. This suggests
that the bulk of the emitting coronal plasma in this AR is not steady;
rather, it is dynamic and constantly evolving. These measurements
provide crucial constraints on any model which seeks to describe coronal
heating.},

observations from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) aboard the
Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). We present the first spatially
resolved maps of the EM slope in the 1-3 MK range within the core of the
AR using several methods, either from approximations or from the
differential emission measure (DEM). A significant variation of the
slope is found at different spatial locations within the active region.
We selected two regions that were not greatly affected by lower
temperature emission along the line of sight. We found that the EM had a
power law of the form EM $\propto$ Tb, with b = 4.4 $\pm$
0.4, and 4.6 $\pm$ 0.4, during the first and second appearance of the
active region, respectively. During the second rotation, line-of-sight
effects become more important, although difficult to estimate. We found
that the use of the ground calibration for Hinode/EIS and the
approximate method to derive the EM, used in previous publications,
produce an underestimation of the slopes. The EM distribution in active
region cores is generally found to be consistent with high frequency
heating, and does not change much during the evolution of the active
region.},

delay between consecutive nanoflares proportional to the energy of the
second nanoflare do lead to the observed range of a. However,
TN must then be of the order of hundreds to no more than a

stressed coronal field to a near-potential state, the time taken to
build up the required magnetic energy is thus too long to account for

that nanoflare energies may be smaller than previously envisioned.},

has a peak density of at least a factor of two lower than a resolved
loop subject to the same heating, with larger discrepancies in the decay
phase. The temperature for underresolved loops is also lower indicating
that lack of resolution does not "bottle up" the heat flux in the
corona. Energy is conserved in the models to under 1\% in all cases,
indicating that this is not responsible for the low density. Instead, we
argue that in underresolved loops the heat flux "jumps across" the
transition region to the dense chromosphere from which it is radiated

emphasizes the point that the interaction between corona and
chromosphere occurs only through the medium of the transition region.

  abstract = {The Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) was launched on 11 February 2010 at 15:23 UT from Kennedy Space Center aboard an Atlas V 401 (AV-021) launch vehicle. A series of apogee-motor firings lifted SDO from an initial geosynchronous transfer orbit into a circular geosynchronous orbit inclined by 28$^\circ$ about the longitude of the SDO-dedicated ground
station in New Mexico. SDO began returning science data on 1 May 2010. SDO is the first space-weather mission in NASA's Living With a
Star (LWS) Program. SDO's main goal is to understand, driving
toward a predictive capability, those solar variations that influence life on Earth and humanity's technological systems. The SDO
science investigations will determine how the Sun's magnetic field is generated and structured, how this stored magnetic energy is released into the heliosphere and geospace as the solar wind, energetic
particles, and variations in the solar irradiance. Insights gained from SDO investigations will also lead to an increased understanding of the role that solar variability plays in changes in Earth's
atmospheric chemistry and climate. The SDO mission includes three scientific investigations (the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA), Extreme Ultraviolet Variability Experiment (EVE), and Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI)), a spacecraft bus, and a dedicated ground station to handle the telemetry. The Goddard Space Flight Center built and will operate the spacecraft during its planned five-year mission life; this includes: commanding the spacecraft, receiving the science data, and forwarding that data to the science teams. The science investigations teams at Stanford University, Lockheed Martin Solar Astrophysics Laboratory (LMSAL), and University of Colorado Laboratory for
Atmospheric and Space Physics (LASP) will process, analyze, distribute, and archive the science data. We will describe the building of SDO and the science that it will provide to NASA.},

  abstract = {The frequency of heating events in the corona is an important constraint 
on the coronal heating mechanisms. Observations indicate that the
intensities and velocities measured in active region cores are
effectively steady, suggesting that heating events occur rapidly enough
to keep high-temperature active region loops close to equilibrium. In
this paper, we couple observations of active region (AR) 10955 made with
the X-Ray Telescope and the EUV Imaging Spectrometer on board Hinode to
test a simple steady heating model. First we calculate the differential
emission measure (DEM) of the apex region of the loops in the active
region core. We find the DEM to be broad and peaked around 3 MK. We then
determine the densities in the corresponding footpoint regions. Using
potential field extrapolations to approximate the loop lengths and the
density-sensitive line ratios to infer the magnitude of the heating, we
build a steady heating model for the active region core and find that we
can match the general properties of the observed DEM for the temperature
range of 6.3 $<$ log T $<$ 6.7. This model, for the first time,
accounts for the base pressure, loop length, and distribution of apex
temperatures of the core loops. We find that the density-sensitive
spectral line intensities and the bulk of the hot emission in the active
region core are consistent with steady heating. We also find, however,
that the steady heating model cannot address the emission observed at
lower temperatures. This emission may be due to foreground or background
structures, or may indicate that the heating in the core is more
complicated. Different heating scenarios must be tested to determine if
they have the same level of agreement.},

thermal conduction, and coupled to the detailed solution of the
equations of the ionization rate for several abundant elements. In our
simulations, initially cool and rarefied magnetic flux tubes are heated
to 10 MK by nanoflares deposited either at the footpoints or at the loop
apex. We test for different pulse durations and find that, due to NEI
effects, the loop plasma may never be detected at temperatures above \textasciitilde{}5

implications in the framework of multistranded nanoflare-heated coronal

We combine hydrodynamic and forward modeling codes with a magnetic field extrapolation to create a model active region and apply the time lag method to synthetic
observations. Our aim is not to reproduce a particular set of
observations in detail, but to recover some typical properties and patterns observed in active regions. Our key findings are the following. (1) Cooling dominates the time lag signature and the time lags between the channel pairs are generally consistent with observed values. (2) Shorter coronal loops in the core cool more quickly than longer loops at the periphery. (3) All channel pairs show zero time lag when the line of sight passes through coronal loop footpoints. (4) There is strong evidence that plasma must be re-energized on a timescale comparable to the cooling timescale to reproduce the observed coronal activity, but it is likely that a relatively broad spectrum of heating frequencies are operating across active regions. (5) Due to their highly dynamic nature, we find nanoflare trains produce zero time lags along entire flux tubes in our model active region that are seen between the same channel pairs in observed active regions.},

We have recently developed a technique that systematically identifies and measures plasma temperature dynamics by computing time lags between light curves. The time lag method tests whether the plasma is maintained at a steady temperature, or if it is dynamic, undergoing heating and cooling cycles. An important aspect of our technique is that it analyzes both observationally distinct coronal loops as well as the much more prevalent diffuse emission between them. We find that the widespread cooling reported previously for NOAA AR 11082 is a generic property of all ARs. The results are consistent with impulsive nanoflare heating followed by slower cooling. Only occasionally, however, is there full cooling from above 7 MK to well below 1 MK. More often, the plasma cools to approximately 1\textendash{}2 MK before being reheated by another nanoflare. These same 15 ARs were first studied by Warren et al. We find that the degree of cooling is not well correlated with the reported slopes of the emission measure distribution. We also conclude that the Fe xviii emitting plasma that they measured is mostly in a state of cooling. These results support the idea that nanoflares have a distribution of energies and frequencies, with the average delay between successive events on an individual flux tube being comparable to the plasma cooling timescale.},

isothermal both along their axis and across their cross section. Even a complex active region observed at the solar limb has been found to be composed of three distinct isothermal plasmas. If confirmed, these results would pose formidable challenges to the current theoretical understanding of the thermal structure and heating of the solar corona. For example, no current theoretical model can explain the excess densities and lifetimes of many observed loops if the loops are in fact isothermal. All of these measurements are based on the so-called emission measure (EM) diagnostic technique that is applied to a set of optically thin lines under the assumption of isothermal plasma. It provides simultaneous measurement of both the temperature and EM. In this work, we develop a new method to quantify the uncertainties in the technique and to rigorously assess its ability to discriminate between isothermal and multithermal plasmas. We define a formal measure of the uncertainty in the EM diagnostic technique that can easily be applied to real data. We here apply it to synthetic data based on a variety of assumed plasma thermal distributions and develop a method to
quantitatively assess the degree of multithermality of a plasma.},

properties of the emission expected from repeating nanoflares (a

electrons and ions. If the emission measure distribution (EM(T)) peaks
at T = T m , we find that EM(T m ) is
independent of details of the nanoflare train, and EM(T) above and below
T m reflects different aspects of the heating. Below T
 m , the main influence is the relationship of the waiting
time between successive nanoflares to the nanoflare energy. Above T
 m , power-law nanoflare distributions lead to an extensive
plasma population not present in a mono-energetic train. Furthermore, in
some cases, characteristic features are present in EM(T). Such details
may be detectable given adequate spectral resolution and a good
knowledge of the relevant atomic physics. In the absence of such
resolution we propose some metrics that can be used to infer the

  abstract = {The corona and transition region (TR) are fundamentally coupled through 
the processes of thermal conduction and mass exchange. It is not
possible to understand one without the other. Yet the
temperature-dependent emissions from the two locations behave quite
differently in the aftermath of an impulsive heating event such as a
coronal nanoflare. Whereas the corona cools sequentially, emitting first
at higher temperatures and then at lower temperatures, the TR is
multithermal and the emission at all temperatures responds in unison. We
have previously applied the automated time lag technique of Viall \&
Klimchuk to disk observations of an active region (AR) made by the
Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on the Solar Dynamics Observatory.
Lines of sight passing through coronal plasma show clear evidence for
post-nanoflare cooling, while lines of sight intersecting the TR
footpoints of coronal strands show zero time lag. In this paper, we use
the EBTEL hydrodynamics code to demonstrate that this is precisely the
expected behavior when the corona is heated by nanoflares. We also apply
the time lag technique for the first time to off-limb observations of an
AR. Since TR emission is not present above the limb, the occurrence of
zero time lags is greatly diminished, supporting the conclusion that
zero time lags measured on the disk are due to TR plasma. Lastly, we
show that the ''coronal'' channels in AIA can be dominated by bright TR
emission. When defined in a physically meaningful way, the TR reaches a
temperature of roughly 60\% the peak temperature in a flux tube. The TR
resulting from impulsive heating can extend to 3 MK and higher, well
within the range of the ''coronal'' AIA channels.},

Here we present hard X-ray data from the second flight of the Focusing Optics X-ray Solar Imager (FOXSI-2), which detected emission above 7\,keV from an active region of the Sun with no obvious individual X-ray flare emission. Through differential emission measure computations, we ascribe this emission to plasma heated above 10\,MK, providing evidence for the existence of solar nanoflares. The quantitative evaluation of the hot plasma strongly constrains the coronal heating models. The authors detect hard X-ray emission produced by plasma heated at $\geq$10 million kelvin from a quiescent active region of the Sun, providing clear observational evidence of plasma heating by nanoflares, and hinting at their important role in coronal heating.},

distinguish between different heating mechanisms. We present an analysis
using Fe and Ca emission lines from both the Solar Ultraviolet
Measurement of Emitted Radiation (SUMER) on board the Solar and
Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) and the EUV Imaging Spectrometer (EIS)
on board Hinode. A data set covering all ionization stages from Fe x to
Fe xix has been used for the thermal analysis (both differential
emission measure and emission measure, EM). Ca xiv is used for the
SUMER-EIS radiometric cross calibration. We show that the very hot
plasma is present and persistent almost everywhere in the core of the
limb AR. The off-limb AR is clearly structured in Fe xviii. Almost
everywhere, the EM analysis reveals plasma at 10 MK (visible in Fe xix
emission), which is down to 0.1\% of EM of the main 3 \{MK\} plasma. We
estimate the power-law index of the hot tail of the EM to be between
-8.5 and -4.4. However, the question about the possible
existence of a small minor peak at around 10 \{MK\} remains open. The
absence in some part of the AR of the Fe xix and Fe xxiii lines (which
fall into our spectral range) enables us to determine an upper limit on
the EM at these temperatures. Our results include a new Ca xiv 943.59

These new observations make possible a unified description of both phenomena. Coronal rain and periodic intensity pulsations of loops are two manifestations of the same physical process: evaporation/condensation cycles resulting from a state of thermal nonequilibrium. The fluctuations around coronal temperatures produce the intensity pulsations of loops, and rain falls along their legs if thermal runaway cools the periodic condensations down and below transition-region temperatures. This scenario is in line with the predictions of numerical models of quasi-steadily and footpoint heated loops. The presence of coronal rain\textemdash{}albeit non-periodic\textemdash{}in several other structures within the studied field of view implies that this type of heating is at play on a large scale.},

An automated processing pipeline keeps pace with observations to produce observable quantities, including the photospheric vector magnetic field, from sequences of filtergrams. The basic vector-field frame list cadence is 135 seconds, but to reduce noise the filtergrams are combined to derive data products every 720 seconds. The primary 720 s observables were released in mid-2010, including Stokes polarization parameters measured at six wavelengths, as well as intensity, Doppler velocity, and the line-of-sight magnetic field. More advanced products, including the full vector magnetic field, are now available. Automatically identified HMI Active Region Patches (HARPs) track the location and shape of magnetic regions throughout their lifetime.The vector field is computed using the Very Fast Inversion of the Stokes Vector (VFISV) code optimized for the HMI pipeline; the remaining 180$\circ$ azimuth ambiguity is resolved with the Minimum Energy (ME0) code. The Milne\textendash{}Eddington inversion is performed on all full-disk HMI observations. The disambiguation, until recently run only on HARP regions, is now implemented for the full disk. Vector and scalar quantities in the patches are used to derive active region indices potentially useful for forecasting; the data maps and indices are collected in the SHARP data series, hmi.sharp\_720s. Definitive SHARP processing is completed only after the region rotates off the visible disk; quick-look products are produced in near real time. Patches are provided in both CCD and heliographic coordinates.HMI provides continuous coverage of the vector field, but has modest spatial, spectral, and temporal resolution. Coupled with limitations of the analysis and interpretation techniques, effects of the orbital velocity, and instrument performance, the resulting measurements have a certain dynamic range and sensitivity and are subject to systematic errors and uncertainties that are characterized in this report.},

  abstract = {Long-period EUV pulsations, recently discovered to be common in active regions, are understood to be the coronal manifestation of thermal nonequilibrium (TNE). The active regions previously studied with EIT/Solar and Heliospheric Observatory and AIA/SDO indicated that long-period intensity pulsations are localized in only one or two loop bundles. The basic idea of this study is to understand why. For this purpose, we tested the response of different loop systems, using different magnetic configurations, to different stratifications and strengths of the heating. We present an extensive parameter-space study using 1D hydrodynamic simulations (1020 in total) and conclude that the occurrence of TNE requires specific combinations of parameters. Our study shows that the TNE cycles are confined to specific ranges in parameter space. This naturally explains why only some loops undergo constant periodic pulsations over several days: since the loop geometry and the heating properties generally vary from one loop to another in an active region, only the ones in which these parameters are compatible exhibit TNE cycles. Furthermore, these parameters (heating and geometry) are likely to vary significantly over the duration of a cycle, which potentially limits the possibilities of periodic behavior. This study also confirms that long-period intensity pulsations and coronal rain are two aspects of the same phenomenon: both phenomena can occur for similar heating conditions and can appear simultaneously in the simulations.},

This review focuses on the optically thin emission from the solar atmosphere, mostly found at UV and X-ray (XUV) wavelengths, and discusses some of the diagnostic methods that have been used to measure electron densities, electron temperatures, differential emission measure (DEM), and relative chemical abundances. We mainly focus on methods and results obtained from high-resolution spectroscopy, rather than broad-band imaging. However, we note that the best results are often obtained by combining imaging and spectroscopic observations. We also mainly focus the review on measurements of electron densities and temperatures obtained from single ion diagnostics, to avoid issues related to the ionisation state of the plasma. We start the review with a short historical introduction on the main XUV high-resolution spectrometers, then review the basics of optically thin emission and the main processes that affect the formation of a spectral line. We mainly discuss plasma in equilibrium, but briefly mention non-equilibrium ionisation and non-thermal electron distributions. We also summarise the status of atomic data, which are an essential part of the diagnostic process. We then review the methods used to measure electron densities, electron temperatures, the DEM, and relative chemical abundances, and the results obtained for the lower solar atmosphere (within a fraction of the solar radii), for coronal holes, the quiet Sun, active regions and flares.},

  abstract = {v0.9.0 (July 2018)
Note: a version of these release notes with working links appears in the online documentation.
This is a major release with several substantial and long-desired new features. There are also updates/modifications to the themes and color palettes that give better consistency with matplotlib 2.0 and some notable API changes.
New relational plots
Three completely new plotting functions have been added: catplot, scatterplot, and lineplot. The first is a figure-level interface to the latter two that combines them with a FacetGrid. The functions bring the high-level, dataset-oriented API of the seaborn categorical plotting functions to more general plots (scatter plots and line plots).
These functions can visualize a relationship between two numeric variables while mapping up to three additional variables by modifying $<$code$>$hue$<$/code$>$, $<$code$>$size$<$/code$>$, and/or $<$code$>$style$<$/code$>$ semantics. The common high-level API is implemented differently in the two functions. For example, the size semantic in scatterplot scales the area of scatter plot points, but in lineplot it scales width of the line plot lines. The API is dataset-oriented, meaning that in both cases you pass the variable in your dataset rather than directly specifying the matplotlib parameters to use for point area or line width.
Another way the relational functions differ from existing seaborn functionality is that they have better support for using numeric variables for $<$code$>$hue$<$/code$>$ and $<$code$>$size$<$/code$>$ semantics. This functionality may be propagated to other functions that can add a $<$code$>$hue$<$/code$>$ semantic in future versions; it has not been in this release.
The lineplot function also has support for statistical estimation and is replacing the older $<$code$>$tsplot$<$/code$>$ function, which still exists but is marked for removal in a future release. lineplot is better aligned with the API of the rest of the library and more flexible in showing relationships across additional variables by modifying the size and style semantics independently. It also has substantially improved support for date and time data, a major pain factor in $<$code$>$tsplot$<$/code$>$. The cost is that some of the more esoteric options in $<$code$>$tsplot$<$/code$>$ for representing uncertainty (e.g. a colormapped KDE of the bootstrap distribution) have not been implemented in the new function.
There is quite a bit of new documentation that explains these new functions in more detail, including detailed examples of the various options in the API reference and a more verbose tutorial.
These functions should be considered in a "stable beta" state. They have been thoroughly tested, but some unknown corner cases may remain to be found. The main features are in place, but not all planned functionality has been implemented. There are planned improvements to some elements, particularly the default legend, that are a little rough around the edges in this release. Finally, some of the default behavior (e.g. the default range of point/line sizes) may change somewhat in future releases.
Updates to themes and palettes
Several changes have been made to the seaborn style themes, context scaling, and color palettes. In general the aim of these changes was to make the seaborn styles more consistent with the style updates in matplotlib 2.0 and to leverage some of the new style parameters for better implementation of some aspects of the seaborn styles. Here is a list of the changes:

Reorganized and updated some axes\_style/plotting\_context parameters to take advantage of improvements in the matplotlib 2.0 update. The biggest change involves using several new parameterss in the "style" spec while moving parameters that used to implement the corresponding aesthetics to the "context" spec. For example, axes spines and ticks are now off instead of having their width/length zeroed out for the darkgrid style. That means the width/length of these elements can now be scaled in different contexts. The effect is a more cohesive appearance of the plots, especially in larger contexts. These changes include only minimal support for the 1.x matplotlib series. Users who are stuck on matplotlib 1.5 but wish to use seaborn styling may want to use the seaborn parameters that can be accessed through the matplotlib stylesheet interface.
Updated the seaborn palettes ("deep", "muted", "colorblind", etc.) to correspond with the new 10-color matplotlib default. The legacy palettes are now available at "deep6", "muted6", "colorblind6", etc. Additionally, a few individual colors were tweaked for better consistency, aesthetics, and accessibility.
Calling color\_palette (or set\_palette) with a named qualitative palettes (i.e. one of the seaborn palettes, the colorbrewer qualitative palettes, or the matplotlib matplotlib tableau-derived palettes) and no specified number of colors will return all of the colors in the palette. This means that for some palettes, the returned list will have a different length than it did in previous versions.
Enhanced color\_palette to accept a parameterized specification of a cubehelix palette in in a string, prefixed with $<$code$>$"ch:"$<$/code$>$ (e.g. $<$code$>$"ch:-.1,.2,l=.7"$<$/code$>$). Note that keyword arguments can be spelled out or referenced using only their first letter. Reversing the palette is accomplished by appending $<$code$>$"\_r"$<$/code$>$, as with other matplotlib colormaps. This specification will be accepted by any seaborn function with a $<$code$>$palette=$<$/code$>$ parameter.
Slightly increased the base font sizes in plotting\_context and increased the scaling factors for $<$code$>$"talk"$<$/code$>$ and $<$code$>$"poster"$<$/code$>$ contexts.
Calling set will now call set\_color\_codes to re-assign the single letter color codes by default

API changes
A few functions have been renamed or have had changes to their default parameters.

The $<$code$>$factorplot$<$/code$>$ function has been renamed to catplot. The new name ditches the original R-inflected terminology to use a name that is more consistent with terminology in pandas and in seaborn itself. This change should hopefully make catplot easier to discover, and it should make more clear what its role is. $<$code$>$factorplot$<$/code$>$ still exists and will pass its arguments through to catplot with a warning. It may be removed eventually, but the transition will be as gradual as possible.
The other reason that the $<$code$>$factorplot$<$/code$>$ name was changed was to ease another alteration which is that the default $<$code$>$kind$<$/code$>$ in catplot is now $<$code$>$"strip"$<$/code$>$ (corresponding to stripplot). This plots a categorical scatter plot which is usually a much better place to start and is more consistent with the default in relplot. The old default style in $<$code$>$factorplot$<$/code$>$ ($<$code$>$"point"$<$/code$>$, corresponding to pointplot) remains available if you want to show a statistical estimation.
The $<$code$>$lvplot$<$/code$>$ function has been renamed to boxenplot. The "letter-value" terminology that was used to name the original kind of plot is obscure, and the abbreviation to $<$code$>$lv$<$/code$>$ did not help anything. The new name should make the plot more discoverable by describing its format (it plots multiple boxes, also known as "boxen"). As with $<$code$>$factorplot$<$/code$>$, the $<$code$>$lvplot$<$/code$>$ function still exists to provide a relatively smooth transition.
Renamed the $<$code$>$size$<$/code$>$ parameter to $<$code$>$height$<$/code$>$ in multi-plot grid objects (FacetGrid, PairGrid, and JointGrid) along with functions that use them ($<$code$>$factorplot$<$/code$>$, lmplot, pairplot, and jointplot) to avoid conflicts with the $<$code$>$size$<$/code$>$ parameter that is used in $<$code$>$scatterplot$<$/code$>$ and $<$code$>$lineplot$<$/code$>$ (necessary to make relplot work) and also makes the meaning of the parameter a bit more clear.
Changed the default diagonal plots in pairplot to use ‘func‘:kdeplot‘ when a $<$code$>$"hue"$<$/code$>$ dimension is used.
Deprecated the statistical annotation component of JointGrid. The method is still available but will be removed in a future version.
Two older functions that were deprecated in earlier versions, $<$code$>$coefplot$<$/code$>$ and $<$code$>$interactplot$<$/code$>$, have undergone final removal from the code base.

Documentation improvements
There has been some effort put into improving the documentation. The biggest change is that the introduction to the library has been completely rewritten to provide much more information and, critically, examples. In addition to the high-level motivation, the introduction also covers some important topics that are often sources of confusion, like the distinction between figure-level and axes-level functions, how datasets should be formatted for use in seaborn, and how to customize the appearance of the plots.
Other improvements have been made throughout, most notably a thorough re-write of the categorical tutorial categorical\_tutorial.
Other small enhancements and bug fixes

Changed rugplot to plot a matplotlib $<$code$>$LineCollection$<$/code$>$ instead of many $<$code$>$Line2D$<$/code$>$ objects, providing a big speedup for large arrays.
Changed the default off-diagonal plots to use scatterplot. (Note that the $<$code$>$"hue"$<$/code$>$ currently draws three separate scatterplots instead of using the hue semantic of the scatterplot function).
Changed color handling when using kdeplot with two variables. The default colormap for the 2D density now follows the color cycle, and the function can use $<$code$>$color$<$/code$>$ and $<$code$>$label$<$/code$>$ kwargs, adding more flexibility and avoiding a warning when using with multi-plot grids.
Added the $<$code$>$subplot\_kws$<$/code$>$ parameter to PairGrid for more flexibility.
Removed a special case in PairGrid that defaulted to drawing stacked histograms on the diagonal axes.
Fixed jointplot/JointGrid and regplot so that they now accept list inputs.
Fixed a bug in FacetGrid when using a single row/column level or using $<$code$>$col\_wrap=1$<$/code$>$.
Fixed functions that set axis limits so that they preserve auto-scaling state on matplotlib 2.0.
Avoided an error when using matplotlib backends that cannot render a canvas (e.g. PDF).
Changed the install infrastructure to explicitly declare dependencies in a way that $<$code$>$pip$<$/code$>$ is aware of. This means that $<$code$>$pip install seaborn$<$/code$>$ will now work in an empty environment. Additionally, the dependencies are specified with strict minimal versions.
Updated the testing infrastructure to execute tests with pytest (although many individual tests still use nose assertion).},

  abstract = {Observations of solar coronal loops have identified several common loop characteristics, including that loops appear to cool and have higher than expected densities. Two potential heating scenarios have been suggested to explain these observations. One scenario is that the loops are formed by many strands, each heated independently by a series of small-scale impulsive heating events, or nanoflares. Another hypothesis is that the heating is quasi-steady and highly stratified, i.e., ``footpoint heating''; such heating can drive thermal nonequilibrium in some structures depending on the scale height and magnitude of the energy deposition, and the geometry of the structure. Studies of both types of heating have found that they can qualitatively reproduce the observed loop properties. The goal of this paper is to identify observables that can be used to differentiate between these two heating scenarios. To do this, we use a single loop geometry. For footpoint heating, we vary the heating magnitude and stratification, for impulsive heating, we vary the heating magnitude. We use one-dimensional hydrodynamic codes to calculate the resulting temperature and density evolution. We convolve the temperature and density with the response functions of four EUV channels of the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly and one filter channel of Hinode 's X-ray Telescope. We consider two principal diagnostics: the time lag between the appearance of the loop in two different channels, and the ratio of the peak intensities of the loop in the two channels. Based on this limited data set, we find (1) that footpoint heating can predict longer time lags than impulsive heating in some channel pairs, (2) that footpoint heating can predict zero or negative time lags in some channel pairs, (3) that the intensity ratio expected from impulsive heating is confined to a narrow range, while footpoint heating predicts a wider range of intensity ratios, and (4) that the range of temperatures expected in impulsive heating is broader than the range of temperatures expected in footpoint heating. This preliminary study identifies observables that may be useful in discriminating between heating models in future work.},

Hard X-ray (HXR) observations with unprecedented sensitivity \&gt;3 keV are now enabled by focusing instruments. We analyzed data from the Focusing Optics X-ray Solar Imager (FOXSI) rocket and the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) spacecraft to constrain properties of AR nanoflares simulated by the EBTEL field-line-averaged hydrodynamics code. We generated model X-ray spectra by computing differential emission measures for homogeneous nanoflare sequences with heating amplitudes H \textsubscript{0}, durations $\tau$, delay times between events t \textsubscript{ N }, and filling factors f. The single quiescent AR observed by FOXSI-2 on 2014 December 11 is well fit by nanoflare sequences with heating amplitudes 0.02 erg cm\textsuperscript{-3} s\textsuperscript{-1} \&lt;H \textsubscript{0} \&lt; 13 erg cm\textsuperscript{-3} s\textsuperscript{-1} and a wide range of delay times and durations. We exclude delays between events shorter than $\sim$900 s at the 90\% confidence level for this region. Three of five regions observed by NuSTAR on 2014 November 1 are well fit by homogeneous nanoflare models, while two regions with higher fluxes are not. Generally, the NuSTAR count spectra are well fit by nanoflare sequences with smaller heating amplitudes, shorter delays, and shorter durations than the allowed FOXSI-2 models. These apparent discrepancies are likely due to differences in spectral coverage between the two instruments and intrinsic differences among the regions. Steady heating (t \textsubscript{ N } = $\tau$) was ruled out with \&gt;99\% confidence for all regions observed by either instrument.},

\AA{} by modeling and subtracting the "warm" contributions to the
emission. HMI/SDO data allow us to focus on "inter-moss" regions in the
loops. The detailed evolution of the inter-moss intensity time series
reveals loops that are impulsively heated in a mode compatible with a
nanoflare storm, with a spike in the hot 131 \AA{} signals leading and
the other five EUV emission channels following in progressive cooling
order. A sharp increase in electron temperature tends to follow closely
after the hot 131 \AA{} signal confirming the impulsive nature of the
process. A cooler process of growing emission measure follows more
slowly. The Fourier power spectra of the hot 131 \AA{} signals, when
averaged over the five loops, present three scaling regimes with break
frequencies near 0.1 min-1 and 0.7 min-1. The low
frequency regime corresponds to 1/f noise; the intermediate indicates a
persistent scaling process and the high frequencies show white noise.
Very similar results are found for the energy dissipation in a 2D
"hybrid" shell model of loop magneto-turbulence, based on reduced
magnetohydrodynamics, that is compatible with nanoflare statistics. We
suggest that such turbulent dissipation is the energy source for our
loops.},

Previous studies have concentrated on cooling the hot plasma by decreasing the coronal heating rate. The difficulty with such models is that when the heating decreases, most of the loop mass is lost by draining onto the chromosphere. It is argued that a prominence condensation is likely to be due to an increase in the heating. The key idea of the model is that the heating increase is spatially dependent so that it is localized nearer to the chromospheric footpoints than to the loop midpoint. Results are presented of numerical simulations of hot loops that are initially heated uniformly, and then undergo heating increases that are concentreated away from the loop midpoint. The temperature at the midpoint first increases, but eventually it collapses to chromospheric values as a result of chromospheric evaporation. Hence, a curious result is obtained, that increasing the heating causes cooling. The resulting densities and time scales agree well with observations. The implications of this model for coronal heating and prominence structure are discussed.},

  abstract = {We analyze coordinated observations of coronal rain in loops, spanning chromospheric, transition region (TR), and coronal temperatures with sub-arcsecond spatial resolution. Coronal rain is found to be a highly multithermal phenomenon with a high degree of co-spatiality in the multi-wavelength emission. EUV darkening and quasi-periodic intensity variations are found to be strongly correlated with coronal rain showers. Progressive cooling of coronal rain is observed, leading to a height dependence of the emission. A fast-slow two-step catastrophic cooling progression is found, which may reflect the transition to optically thick plasma states. The intermittent and clumpy appearance of coronal rain at coronal heights becomes more continuous and persistent at chromospheric heights just before impact, mainly due to a funnel effect from the observed expansion of the magnetic field. Strong density inhomogeneities of 0$\backslash$buildrel\{$\backslash$prime$\backslash$prime\}$\backslash$over\{.\}
2-0$\backslash$buildrel\{$\backslash$prime$\backslash$prime\}$\backslash$over\{.\} 5 are found, in which a transition from temperatures of 105 to 104 K occurs. The 0$\backslash$buildrel\{$\backslash$prime$\backslash$prime\}$\backslash$over\{.\}
2-0$\backslash$buildrel\{$\backslash$prime$\backslash$prime\}$\backslash$over\{.\} 8 width of the distribution of coronal rain is found to be independent of temperature. The sharp increase in the number of clumps at the coolest temperatures, especially at higher resolution, suggests that the bulk distribution of the rain remains undetected. Rain clumps appear organized in strands in both chromospheric and TR temperatures. We further find structure reminiscent of the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) thermal mode (also known as entropy mode), thereby suggesting an important role of thermal instability in shaping the basic loop substructure. Rain core densities are estimated to vary between 2 \texttimes{} 1010 and 2.5\texttimes{}

  abstract = {Reported observations in H$\alpha$, Ca II H, and K or other chromospheric lines of coronal rain trace back to the days of the Skylab mission. Corresponding to cool and dense plasma, coronal rain is often observed falling down along coronal loops in active regions. A physical explanation for this spectacular phenomenon has been put forward thanks to numerical simulations of loops with footpoint-concentrated heating, a heating scenario in which cool condensations naturally form in the corona. This effect has been termed "catastrophic cooling" and is the predominant explanation for coronal rain. In this work, we further investigate the link between this phenomenon and the heating mechanisms acting in the corona. We start by analyzing observations of coronal rain at the limb in the Ca II H line performed by the Hinode satellite, and derive interesting statistical properties concerning the dynamics. We then compare the observations with 1.5-dimensional MHD simulations of loops being heated by small-scale discrete events concentrated toward the footpoints (that could come, for instance, from magnetic reconnection events), and by Alfv\'en waves generated at the photospheric level. Both our observation and simulation results suggest that coronal rain is a far more common phenomenon than previously thought. Also, we show that the structure and dynamics of condensations are far more sensitive to the internal pressure changes in loops than to gravity. Furthermore, it is found that if a loop is predominantly heated from Alfv\'en waves, coronal rain is inhibited due to the characteristic uniform heating they produce. Hence, coronal rain may not only point to the spatial distribution of the heating in coronal loops but also to the agent of the heating itself. We thus propose coronal rain as a marker for coronal heating mechanisms.},

  annote = {We discuss the problem of determining plasma structure from optically thin emission lines whose emission coefficients and frequency-integrated intensities are dependent on temperature T and electron density n. We cast the problem into the inverse form discussed by Hubeny \& Judge (1995). Three properties of the kernels in the integral equations lead to fundamental limitations in trying to determine the source term $\mu$(T, n), the ``emission measure differential in temperature and density,'' from a set of emission-line intensities. First, the kernels are rather weakly dependent on n. Second, they have asymptotically identical dependencies on n. The inverse problem is therefore very poorly conditioned in the density dimension. Third, the kernels cannot (and may never) be calculated with an accuracy better than $\pm$10\%. These properties set limits on the accuracy of all solutions, independent of the accuracy of observed line intensities. This concurs with earlier but less general work by Brown et al. (1991). We try to determine solutions for $\mu$(T, n), using specific target sources and numerical algorithms. Using realistic uncertainties, calculations indicate that meaningful inverse solutions for $\mu$(T, n) cannot be obtained owing to the severe propagation of kernel errors, irrespective of the quality of observational data. Solutions for the ``emission measure differential in temperature'' $\xi$(T) = $\int$ $\mu$(T, n)dn are more robust against instabilities driven by poor conditioning. Since traditional ``emission-line diagnostic ratios'' can only be defined through $\mu$(T, n) (or some generalization thereof), our analysis casts doubt on the meaning of plasma properties derived from such line ratios, and illustrates the severe nonuniqueness of any equivalent ``inverse'' solution. This work may be important for studying a wide variety of atomic and ionic emission-line spectra, including work with instruments on SOHO and the Hubble Space Telescope.}

  annote = {We perform emission measure analysis of new and accurate UV ($\lambda$ $>$ 1200 \AA{}) and extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) ($\lambda$ $\leq$ 1200 \AA{}) irradiance (``Sun-as-a-star'') emission-line spectra of the Sun. Our data consist of (1) daily averaged UV irradiances from the SOLSTICE on the UARS spacecraft and (2) EUV irradiances obtained on the same date from a m spectrograph flown on a sounding rocket. Both instruments have a spectral resolution of roughly 1 \AA. The absolute uncertainties in these data are at most $\pm$15\% ( $\pm$ 2 $\sigma$), one of the highest photometric accuracies yet achieved. We find large, highly significant and systematic discrepancies in the emission measure analysis of transition region lines which can only be accounted for by a breakdown of one or more standard assumptions. All strong lines above 1000 \AA, which are from the Li and Na isoelectronic sequences, are too strong by factors of between 2.5 and 7 compared with their counterparts in the EUV region. Previous studies were tantalizingly close to finding these discrepancies, but those data lacked the wavelength coverage and relative photometric precision necessary for definitive conclusions. We argue that either dynamical effects, inaccurate treatments of atomic processes, and/or Lyman continuum absorption are the culprits. However, we favor the former explanation. In any event, this study should have implications for models of the solar transition region, for observing programs with the CDS and SUMER instruments on SOHO, and for analysis of UV spectra for stars across the cool half of the H-R diagram. Finally, the discrepancy is not seen for the ``coronal'' Li-like ions.}

  abstract = {The problem of deriving the temperature distribution in hot optically thin plasmas from their X-ray spectra is discussed, and it is argued that X-ray spectral data are fundamentally insensitive to the thermal structure of the source, regardless of the spectral resolution of the observations. The problem is formulated in terms of the integral equation which relates both line and continuous spectra to the differential emission measure of the source. The mathematical difficulties underlying the solution of such integral equations are outlined, emphasizing the key role of the kernel function. Continuous bremsstrahlung spectra are considered, and it is shown that the kernel involved (the Laplace transform) is highly unstable to small perturbations in the spectrum due to the flatness of the kernel function. The line-spectrum problem is examined, and gross errors in the solution are shown to result from very small observational errors. A specific example for solar active regions demonstrates that most existing models for the differential emission measure are likely to be spurious. Suggestions are made for the most realistic and economic approach to analysis of existing spectra as well as for designs of future spectrometers.},

  doi = {10.1088/0004-637X/719/1/576},
  abstract = {Coronal active regions are observed to get increasingly fuzzy (i.e., increasingly confused and uniform) in increasingly hard energy bands or lines. We explain this as evidence of fine multi-temperature structure of coronal loops. To this end, we model bundles of loops made of thin strands, each heated by short and intense heat pulses. For simplicity, we assume that the heat pulses are all equal and triggered only once in each strand at a random time. The pulse intensity and cadence are selected so as to have steady active region loops (\textasciitilde{}3 MK) on average. We compute the evolution of the confined heated plasma with a hydrodynamic loop model. We then compute the emission along each strand in several spectral lines, from cool (\&lt;=1 MK), to warm (2-3 MK) lines, detectable with Hinode/Extreme-ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer, to hot X-ray lines. The strands are then put side by side to construct an active region loop bundle. We find that in the warm lines (2-3 MK) the loop emission fills all the available image surface. Therefore, the emission appears quite uniform and it is difficult to resolve the single loops, while in the cool lines the loops are considerably more contrasted and the region is less fuzzy. The main reasons for this effect are that, during their evolution, i.e., pulse heating and slow cooling, each strand spends a relatively long time at temperatures around 2-3 MK and it has a high emission measure during that phase, so the whole region appears more uniform or smudged. We predict that fuzziness should be reduced in the hot UV and X-ray lines.},

  annote = {PythonTeX is a LaTeX package that allows Python code in LaTeX documents to be executed and provides access to the output. This makes possible reproducible documents that combine results with the code required to generate them. Calculations and figures may be next to the code that created them. Since code is adjacent to its output in the document, editing may be more efficient. Since code output may be accessed programmatically in the document, copy-and-paste errors are avoided and output is always guaranteed to be in sync with the code that generated it. This paper provides an introduction to PythonTeX and an overview of major features, including performance optimizations, debugging tools, and dependency tracking. Several complete examples are presented. Finally, advanced features are summarized. Though PythonTeX was designed for Python, it may be extended to support additional languages; support for the Ruby and Julia languages is already included. PythonTeX contains a utility for converting documents into plain LaTeX, suitable for format conversion, sharing, and journal submission.}
