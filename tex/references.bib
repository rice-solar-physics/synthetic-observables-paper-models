  abstract = {This paper develops the zero-dimensional (0D) hydrodynamic coronal loop model "Enthalpy-based Thermal Evolution of Loops" (EBTEL) proposed by Klimchuk et al., which studies the plasma response to evolving coronal heating, especially impulsive heating events. The basis of EBTEL is the modeling of mass exchange between the corona and transition region (TR) and chromosphere in response to heating variations, with the key parameter being the ratio of the TR to coronal radiation. We develop new models for this parameter that now include gravitational stratification and a physically motivated approach to radiative cooling. A number of examples are presented, including nanoflares in short and long loops, and a small flare. The new features in EBTEL are important for accurate tracking of, in particular, the density. The 0D results are compared to a 1D hydro code (Hydrad) with generally good agreement. EBTEL is suitable for general use as a tool for (1) quick-look results of loop evolution in response to a given heating function, (2) extensive parameter surveys, and (3) situations where the modeling of hundreds or thousands of elemental loops is needed. A single run takes a few seconds on a contemporary laptop.},

the Enthalpy Based Thermal Evolution of Loops code. Here we study a
single nanoflare and show that while simple models predict an emission
measure distribution extending well above 10 MK, which is consistent
with cooling by thermal conduction, many other effects are likely to
limit the existence and detectability of such plasmas. These include:
differential heating between electrons and ions, ionization
non-equilibrium, and for short nanoflares, the time taken for the
coronal density to increase. The most useful temperature range to look
for this plasma, often called the ``smoking gun'' of nanoflare
heating, lies between 106.6 and 107 K. Signatures
of the actual heating may be detectable in some instances.},

  abstract = {We present observations of high-temperature emission in the core of a 
solar active region using instruments on Hinode and the Solar Dynamics
Observatory (SDO). These multi-instrument observations allow us to
determine the distribution of plasma temperatures and follow the
evolution of emission at different temperatures. We find that at the
apex of the high-temperature loops the emission measure distribution is
strongly peaked near 4 MK and falls off sharply at both higher and lower
temperatures. Perhaps most significantly, the emission measure at 0.5 MK
is reduced by more than two orders of magnitude from the peak at 4 MK.
We also find that the temporal evolution in broadband soft X-ray images
is relatively constant over about 6 hr of observing. Observations in the
cooler SDO/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) bandpasses generally do
not show cooling loops in the core of the active region, consistent with
the steady emission observed at high temperatures. These observations
suggest that the high-temperature loops observed in the core of an
active region are close to equilibrium. We find that it is possible to
reproduce the relative intensities of high-temperature emission lines
with a simple, high-frequency heating scenario where heating events
occur on timescales much less than a characteristic cooling time. In
contrast, low-frequency heating scenarios, which are commonly invoked to
describe nanoflare models of coronal heating, do not reproduce the
relative intensities of high-temperature emission lines and predict
low-temperature emission that is approximately an order of magnitude too
large. We also present an initial look at images from the SDO/AIA 94
\AA{} channel, which is sensitive to Fe XVIII.},

  abstract = {Observational and theoretical evidence suggests that coronal heating is impulsive and occurs on very small cross-field spatial scales. A single coronal loop could contain a hundred or more individual strands that are heated quasi-independently by nanoflares. It is therefore an enormous undertaking to model an entire active region or the global corona. Three-dimensional MHD codes have inadequate spatial resolution, and one-dimensional (1D) hydrodynamic codes are too slow to simulate the many thousands of elemental strands that must be treated in a reasonable representation. Fortunately, thermal conduction and flows tend to smooth out plasma gradients along the magnetic field, so zero-dimensional (0D) models are an acceptable alternative. We have developed a highly efficient model called ``enthalpy-based thermal evolution of loops'' (EBTEL), which accurately describes the evolution of the average temperature, pressure, and density along a coronal strand. It improves significantly on earlier models of this type-in accuracy, flexibility, and capability. It treats both slowly varying and highly impulsive coronal heating; it provides the time-dependent differential emission measure distribution, DEM(T), at the transition region footpoints; and there are options for heat flux saturation and nonthermal electron beam heating. EBTEL gives excellent agreement with far more sophisticated 1D hydrodynamic simulations despite using 4 orders of magnitude less computing time. It promises to be a powerful new tool for solar and stellar studies.},

  abstract = {A well-known behavior of EUV light curves of discrete coronal loops is 
that the peak intensities of cooler channels or spectral lines are
reached at progressively later times than hotter channels. This time lag
is understood to be the result of hot coronal loop plasma cooling
through these lower respective temperatures. However, loops typically
comprise only a minority of the total emission in active regions (ARs).
Is this cooling pattern a common property of AR coronal plasma, or does
it only occur in unique circumstances, locations, and times? The new
Solar Dynamics Observatory/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (SDO/AIA) data
provide a wonderful opportunity to answer this question systematically
for an entire AR. We measure the time lag between pairs of SDO/AIA EUV
channels using 24 hr of images of AR 11082 observed on 2010 June 19. We
find that there is a time-lag signal consistent with cooling plasma,
just as is usually found for loops, throughout the AR including the
diffuse emission between loops for the entire 24 hr duration. The
pattern persists consistently for all channel pairs and choice of window
length within the 24 hr time period, giving us confidence that the
plasma is cooling from temperatures of greater than 3 MK, and sometimes
exceeding 7 MK, down to temperatures lower than \textasciitilde{}0.8 MK. This suggests
that the bulk of the emitting coronal plasma in this AR is not steady;
rather, it is dynamic and constantly evolving. These measurements
provide crucial constraints on any model which seeks to describe coronal
heating.},

to study the thermal evolution of coronal loops subjected to
time-dependent heating. This paper presents a comparison of a number of
0D models that have been published in the past and is intended to
provide a guide for those interested in either using the old models or
developing new ones. The principal difference between the models is the
way the exchange of mass and energy between corona, transition region,
and chromosphere is treated, as plasma cycles into and out of a loop
during a heating-cooling cycle. It is shown that models based on the
principles of mass and energy conservation can give satisfactory results
at some or, in the case of the Enthalpy-based Thermal Evolution of Loops
model, all stages of the loop evolution. Empirical models can have
significant difficulties in obtaining accurate behavior due to
invocation of assumptions incompatible with the correct exchange of mass
and energy between corona, transition region, and chromosphere.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we examine 15 different active regions (ARs) observed with the Solar Dynamics Observatory and analyze their nanoflare properties. We have recently developed a technique that systematically identifies and measures plasma temperature dynamics by computing time lags between light curves. The time lag method tests whether the plasma is maintained at a steady temperature, or if it is dynamic, undergoing heating and cooling cycles. An important aspect of our technique is that it analyzes both observationally distinct coronal loops as well as the much more prevalent diffuse emission between them. We find that the widespread cooling reported previously for NOAA AR 11082 is a generic property of all ARs. The results are consistent with impulsive nanoflare heating followed by slower cooling. Only occasionally, however, is there full cooling from above 7 MK to well below 1 MK. More often, the plasma cools to approximately 1\textendash{}2 MK before being reheated by another nanoflare. These same 15 ARs were first studied by Warren et al. We find that the degree of cooling is not well correlated with the reported slopes of the emission measure distribution. We also conclude that the Fe xviii emitting plasma that they measured is mostly in a state of cooling. These results support the idea that nanoflares have a distribution of energies and frequencies, with the average delay between successive events on an individual flux tube being comparable to the plasma cooling timescale.},
