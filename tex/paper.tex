\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

This is my whole paper. There is not much here. Here's how to cite a
paper \citet{viall_evidence_2012}. Here's another example of how to cite
a paper \citep{warren_constraints_2011}.

\authorcomment1{What is(are) the overall point(s) of this paper?}

\section{Modeling}
\label{modeling}
In this section, we describe our pipeline for building a model active region and discuss each of the pieces in detail.

\subsection{Magnetic Field Extrapolation}
\label{field}
\authorcomment1{Give details about method used to perform field extrapolation, how the fieldlines are traced. Show fieldlines overlaid on magnetogram.}

We choose active region (AR) NOAA 1158, as observed by the HMI instrument \citet{hoeksema_helioseismic_2014} on 12 February 2011, from the list of active regions studied by \citet{warren_systematic_2012}. We model the geometry of AR NOAA 1158 by computing the three-dimensional magnetic field using the potential field extrapolation method of \citet{schmidt_observable_1964} as outlined in section 3 of \citet{sakurai_greens_1982}.

    \label{fig:magnetogram}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Loop Hydrodynamics}
\label{loops}
The low plasma-$\beta$ in the corona allows us to model the solar atmosphere as an ensemble of independently-heating loops using a field-aligned hydrodynamic model. To model the dynamics of each individual loop, we use the enthalpy-based thermal evolution of loops (EBTEL) model \citep{klimchuk_highly_2008,cargill_enthalpy-based_2012}. Specifically, we use the version of two-fluid version of the EBTEL model as described in \citep{barnes_inference_2016}. EBTEL solves the time-dependent, spatially-integrated hydrodynamic equations and has been successfully benchmarked against field-aligned hydrodynamic codes. Though EBTEL only computes spatially-averaged quantities in the coronal portion of the loop, its efficiency allows us to calculate time-dependent solutions for many thousands of loops in 


\subsection{Heating Model}
\label{heating}
Explain the impulsive heating model, the different frequencies that will be used, the method for constraining the model. Also discuss how the underlying structure and strength of the field may influence the heating and thus the synthesized emission.

Effects of ion heating?

\subsection{Forward Modeling}
\label{forward}
This section will summarize our pipeline for building our forward model (by example). Explain here what AR we have chosen and brief outline of the section.

\subsubsection{Atomic Physics}
\label{atomic}
To calculate the forward modeled intensities, we account for the contributions of all transitions of all ions for a selected number of elements (see \autoref{tab:element_table}). For an optically thin, high-temperature ($\sim10^6$ K), low-density ($\sim10^9$ cm$^{-3}$) plasma, the radiated power per unit volume for a transition $\lambda_{ij}$ of an electron in ion $k$ of element $X$ is given by,

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:ppuv}
    P(\lambda_{ij}) = n_j(X_k)A_{ji}\Delta E_{ji},\quad[\text{erg cm}^{-3}\text{ s}^{-1}]
\end{equation}
where $n_j$ is the number density of ions $X_k$ in excited state $j$, $A_{ji}$ is the Einstein coefficient, and $\Delta E_{ji}=hc/\lambda_{ij}$ is the energy of the emitted photon  \citep[see][]{mason_spectroscopic_1994,bradshaw_collisional_2013}. \autoref{eq:ppuv} can be rewritten in the more useful form,

\begin{eqnarray*}
    P(\lambda_{ij}) &=& \frac{n_j(X_k)}{n(X_k)}\frac{n(X_k)}{n(X)}\frac{n(X)}{n(H)}\frac{n(H)}{n_e}n_eA_{ji}\Delta E_{ji}, \\
    &=& N_j(X,k) f_{X,k} \mathrm{Ab}(X) 0.83 n_e A_{ji} \Delta E_{ji}, \\
    &=& 0.83 \mathrm{Ab}(X) f_{X,k} N_j(X,k) A_{ji} \Delta E_{ji} n_e,
\end{eqnarray*}
where, $N_j$ is the fractional energy level population of level $j$, $f_{X,k}$ is the fractional population of ion $k$, $\mathrm{Ab}(X)$ is the abundance of element $X$ relative to hydrogen, and the ratio of hydrogen and electron number densities is $\approx0.83$. 

Noting that the \textit{emissivity} of the spectral line can be written as $\epsilon_{ij}=N_j A_{ji} \Delta E_{ji}$
\begin{deluxetable}{ccc}
    \caption{Elements including in forward-modeled intensity calculation\label{tab:element_table}}
    \tablehead{
        \colhead{Element} & \colhead{Number of Ions} & \colhead{Number of Transitions}
    }
    \startdata
    \enddata
\end{deluxetable}

Show expression for the intensity and discuss components and how they are calculated, i.e. with CHIANTI. Give details about non-equilibrium ionization calculation as well.

Include table with all elements, including number of ions and number of transitions

\subsubsection{Instrument Effects}
\label{instrument}

Make point about using instrument response functions versus including a full nonequilibrium treatment. This will be discussed more in depth in the results section as well. Show a $n-T$ phase space for typical loop evolution and then for constant pressure.

Show plot of temperature response functions with contributions from each element overlaid

How the emission is binned, point-spread function applied, correct resolution. Some details about how results can be analyzed in same manner as real observations. This can be relatively brief.

Also show that our chosen elements fill in the temperature response function appropriately.

\subsection{Timelag Analysis}
\label{timelag_analysis}

\authorcomment1{Describe how timelag is calculated, give formulas, show an example maybe (or just refer to previous papers)}

\section{Results}
\label{results}
\authorcomment1{Cooling, high, intermediate, and low frequency cases. How should these be divided up?}
Focus on three criteria: heating frequency, nonequilibrium ionization, line-of-sight

\subsection{Heating Scenarios}
Compare different heating frequencies for different channel pairs using maps and histograms

Compare with observations shown in \citet{viall_survey_2017}.

\subsection{Equilibrium versus Nonequilibrium Ionization}
How does nonequilibrium ionization affect the timelag results? Discuss for one heating case and compare distributions of timelag maps for both cases. Would probably be good to show an example of the ion populations for a particular loop as well.

\subsection{Effects Due to Line-of-Sight}
Compute timelag maps for multiple viewing angles. In addition to the actual angle, use angle perpendicular to surface normal and angle parallel to the surface normal.
